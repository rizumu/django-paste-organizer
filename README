Keep all your pastes in one place:

Itch: The free writeboard.com service provides no central place to view all your 
writeboards in addition to obscuring your url names. 

Scratch: This app allows easier team collaboration on multiple writeboards by simply 
displaying a list of links to all your writeboards at a url on your website. In 
addition it allows organizing pastes on other services such as dpaste, gist, 
pastie, etc.
